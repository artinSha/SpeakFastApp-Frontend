# SpeakFast — AI English Conversation App

SpeakFast is an interactive English-speaking practice platform for ESL learners.  
It simulates realistic phone conversations with an AI partner and provides instant grammar feedback at the end of each session.





---

## Overview

1. A user starts a simulated “call.”
2. The app selects a scenario (for example, airport check-in or food order).
3. The AI, powered by Google Gemini, begins the conversation.
4. The user replies using voice, which is transcribed using Google Speech-to-Text.
5. The AI continues naturally based on context.
6. When the call ends, the app analyzes the user’s speech and returns:
   - Grammar feedback
   - Suggested corrections
   - Success percentage
   - Number of turns and grammar issues

All conversations are stored in MongoDB. AI voice responses are generated using ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech.
